## Question
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 
But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". 
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

## Example
```javascript
const fizzBuzz = () => {
    for(let i = 1; i <= 100; i++){
        if(i%3 === 0 && i%5 === 0){
            console.log("FizzBuzz")
        } else if(i%3 === 0 ){
            console.log("Fizz")
        } else if(i%5 === 0){
            console.log("Buzz")
        } else {
            console.log(i)
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation
The operation is simple.
We loop through the numbers from 1 to 100 and check if the number is divisible by 3, 5 or both. 
If it is divisible by 3, we print "Fizz", if it is divisible by 5, we print "Buzz" and if it is divisible by both 3 and 5, we print "FizzBuzz". 
If none of the conditions are met, we print the number itself.

## Complexity Analysis
The time complexity for this algorithm is O(n) where n is the number of elements in the array.


## Alternatives
```javascript
const fizzBuzz = () => {
    Array.from({length: 10}, (_, i) => {
        i++
        let output = ""
        if(i % 3 === 0) output += "Fizz"
        if(i % 5 === 0) output += "Buzz"
        console.log(output || i)
    })
}
