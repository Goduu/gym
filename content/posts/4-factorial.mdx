## Question
Write a function that computes the factorial of a given number.

## Example
```ts
const factorial = (val: number) => {
    let result = 1
    for(let i = val; i > 0; i--){
        result *= val
    }
}
```

### Explanation
The operation is simple.
We loop through the numbers from 1 to 100 and check if the number is divisible by 3, 5 or both. 
If it is divisible by 3, we print "Fizz", if it is divisible by 5, we print "Buzz" and if it is divisible by both 3 and 5, we print "FizzBuzz". 
If none of the conditions are met, we print the number itself.

## Complexity Analysis
The time complexity for this algorithm is O(n) where n is the number of elements in the array.


## Alternatives
```javascript
const fizzBuzz = () => {
    Array.from({length: 10}, (_, i) => {
        i++
        let output = ""
        if(i % 3 === 0) output += "Fizz"
        if(i % 5 === 0) output += "Buzz"
        console.log(output || i)
    })
}
