## Question
Write a function that finds the sum of all elements in an array.

## Example
```ts
const sumArray = (myArray: List[number]) => {
   return myArray.reduce((acc, current) => acc + current, 0)
}
```



### Explanation
The operation is simple.
We loop through the numbers from 1 to 100 and check if the number is divisible by 3, 5 or both. 
If it is divisible by 3, we print "Fizz", if it is divisible by 5, we print "Buzz" and if it is divisible by both 3 and 5, we print "FizzBuzz". 
If none of the conditions are met, we print the number itself.

## Complexity Analysis
The time complexity for this algorithm is O(n) where n is the value given to the function.


## Alternative
### Recursive
```javascript
const sumArray = (myArray: List[number]) => {
   const result = 0
   for(const i of myArray){
    result += i
   }
   return result
}
```
