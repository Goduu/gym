## Question
Write a function that finds the largest number in an array.

## Example
```ts
const reverseInteger = (myInteger: int) => {
   const reversed =  parseInt(int.toString().split('').reverse().join(''))
   return Math.sign(myInteger) * reversed
}
```

### Explanation
The operation is simple.
We loop through the numbers from 1 to 100 and check if the number is divisible by 3, 5 or both. 
If it is divisible by 3, we print "Fizz", if it is divisible by 5, we print "Buzz" and if it is divisible by both 3 and 5, we print "FizzBuzz". 
If none of the conditions are met, we print the number itself.

## Complexity Analysis
The time complexity for this algorithm is O(n) where n is the value given to the function.


## Alternative
### For loop
```ts
const findLargest = (myArray: List[number]) => {
   let result = 0
   for(const i of myArray){
    if(i > result){
      result = i
    }
   }
   return result
}
```

### Lodash
```ts
import {max} from lodash

const findLargest = (myArray: List[number]) => {
   return max(myArray)
}
```

### Not so good with sorting
```ts
const findLargest = (myArray: List[number]) => {
   return myArray.sort((a,b) => a<b)[0]
}
```
