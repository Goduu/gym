## Question
Write a function that removes duplicate elements from an array.

## Example
```ts
const removeDuplicates = (myArray: number[]) => {
   return Array.from(new Set(myArray))
}
```

### Explanation
The operation is simple.
We loop through the numbers from 1 to 100 and check if the number is divisible by 3, 5 or both. 
If it is divisible by 3, we print "Fizz", if it is divisible by 5, we print "Buzz" and if it is divisible by both 3 and 5, we print "FizzBuzz". 
If none of the conditions are met, we print the number itself.

## Complexity Analysis
The time complexity for this algorithm is O(n) where n is the value given to the function.


## Alternative
### For loop
```ts
const findLargest = (myArray: number[]) => {
   let result = []
   for(const i of myArray){
      if(!result.includes(i)){
         result.append(i)
      }
   }
   return result
}
```

### Spreeding
```ts
function removeDuplicates(myArray: number[]) {
    return [...new Set(myArray)];
}
```
