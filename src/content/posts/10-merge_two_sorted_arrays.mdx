## Question
Write a function that receives two sorted arrays and merges them into a single sorted array.

<CodeEditor 
    initialCode={"const mergeSortedArrays = (array1, array2) => {\n...\n}"}
    checkTests={[
        {
        call: "mergeSortedArrays([1,2,3], [4,5,6])",
        expectedResult: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
        },
        {
        call: "mergeSortedArrays([1,1,2,6], [2,7,9])",
        expectedResult: [1,1,2,2,6,7,9]
        },
        {
        call: "mergeSortedArrays([-1,0,3,3,9], [-2,0,7,10])",
        expectedResult: [-2,-1,0,0,3,3,7,9,10],
        hidden: true
        },
        ]}

## Solution

### Two-Pointer Approach
```js
const mergeSortedArrays = (array1, array2) => {
    let pointer1 = 0
    let pointer2 = 0
  
    const result = []
    while(pointer1 < array1.length || pointer2 < array2.length){
      if(pointer1 < array1.length){
        if(pointer2 < array2.length){
          if(array1[pointer1] < array2[pointer2]){
            result.push(array1[pointer1])
            pointer1 += 1
          } else {
            result.push(array2[pointer2])
            pointer2 += 1
          }
        } else {
          result.push(array1[pointer1])
          pointer1 += 1
        }
      } else {
        result.push(array2[pointer2])
        pointer2 += 1
      }
    }
    
    return result
  }
```
### Explanation
1. The function `mergeSortedArrays` takes two sorted arrays as input.
2. It initializes two pointers, `pointer1` and `pointer2`, to keep track of the current index in each array.
3. It then initializes an empty array `result` to store the merged sorted array.
4. The function uses a while loop to iterate over the arrays until both pointers reach the end of their respective arrays.
5. It compares the elements at the current indices of the two arrays and pushes the smaller element into the `result` array.
6. It then increments the pointer of the array from which the element was pushed.
7. If one of the arrays has been fully traversed, the function pushes the remaining elements of the other array into the `result` array.
8. Finally, it returns the merged sorted array.


### Concatenate and Sort

```js
const mergeSortedArrays = (array1, array2) => {
    return array1.concat(array2).sort((a, b) => a - b);
}
```

### Explanation
1. The function `mergeSortedArrays` takes two arrays as input.
2. It concatenates the two arrays using the `concat` method.
3. It then sorts the concatenated array using the `sort` method with a comparator function that compares two elements `a` and `b` and returns a negative value if `a` should come before `b`, a positive value if `a` should come after `b`, and zero if they are equal.

## Complexity Analysis
The time complexity for this solution is O((n+m)log(n+m)), where n and m are the lengths of the two input arrays.
This is because the `sort` method has a time complexity of O(nlogn), where n is the length of the array.
