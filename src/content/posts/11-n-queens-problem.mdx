## Question
Given an N×N chessboard, the task is to place N queens on the board in such a way that no two queens threaten each other.
In chess, a queen can move horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, so no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.
The function should return the number of possible solutions.

## Solution

### Basic idea
Here's a general approach to solving the N-Queens problem using backtracking:

- Start with an empty N×N chessboard.
- Place a queen in the first row.
- Move to the next row and place a queen in a safe position.
- Continue this process recursively until all queens are placed or until it's not possible to place a queen without violating the constraints.
- If a solution is found (i.e., all queens are placed), add it to the list of solutions.
- Backtrack to explore other possibilities.

```js
const solveNQueens = (n) => {
    const result = [];
    
    // Helper function to check if a queen can be placed at position (row, col)
    function isSafe(board, row, col) {
        // Check if there's a queen in the same column
        for (let i = 0; i < row; i++) {
            if (board[i] === col || 
                board[i] === col - (row - i) || 
                board[i] === col + (row - i)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
    
    // Helper function to recursively find all solutions
    const backtrack = (row, board) => {
        if (row === n) {
            // If all queens are placed, add the current board configuration to the result
            result.push(board.map(col => '.'.repeat(col) + 'Q' + '.'.repeat(n - col - 1)));
            return;
        }
        
        // Try placing the queen in each column of the current row
        for (let col = 0; col < n; col++) {
            if (isSafe(board, row, col)) {
                board.push(col);
                backtrack(row + 1, board);
                board.pop(); // Backtrack
            }
        }
    }
    
    backtrack(0, []);
    return result.length;
}

```

### Explanation
1. The `solveNQueens` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of possible solutions to the N-Queens problem.
2. The function initializes an empty array `result` to store the solutions.
3. The `isSafe` function checks if a queen can be placed at position `(row, col)` on the board.
4. The `backtrack` function is a recursive helper function that finds all solutions to the N-Queens problem.
5. The base case of the recursion is when `row === n`, i.e., all queens are placed on the board.
6. If the base case is reached, the current board configuration is added to the `result` array.
7. The `backtrack` function tries placing the queen in each column of the current row, checking if it is safe to place the queen at that position.
8. If it is safe, the queen is placed in that column, and the function is called recursively for the next row.
9. After the recursive call, the queen is removed from the board to backtrack and try other positions.
10. The `solveNQueens` function calls the `backtrack` function with the initial row set to 0 and an empty board configuration.
11. Finally, the function returns the length of the `result` array, which contains all possible solutions to the N-Queens problem.

## Complexity Analysis
The time complexity of this solution is O(N!), where N is the size of the chessboard.
This is because the function tries all possible combinations of queen placements on the board.

## Definition
Backtracking is a technique used to find solutions incrementally by trying different options and abandoning those that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem.
## Application
Backtracking is useful for solving problems with a constraint satisfaction aspect, such as finding a path through a maze, solving Sudoku puzzles, or solving the N-Queens problem.
