## Question
Merge Sort is a sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer approach. 
The problem is to sort an array of elements in non-decreasing order (ascending order), 
i.e., rearrange the elements such that they are in increasing order.

### Tip
The Merge Sort algorithm works as follows:

Divide: Divide the unsorted array into two halves recursively until each sub-array contains only one element.

Conquer: Merge the divided sub-arrays by sorting and combining them in a manner that results in a single sorted array.

## Solution

### Basic idea
Here's a general approach to solving the N-Queens problem using backtracking:

- Start with an empty NÃ—N chessboard.
- Place a queen in the first row.
- Move to the next row and place a queen in a safe position.
- Continue this process recursively until all queens are placed or until it's not possible to place a queen without violating the constraints.
- If a solution is found (i.e., all queens are placed), add it to the list of solutions.
- Backtrack to explore other possibilities.

```js
const mergeSort = (arr) => {
    if (arr.length <= 1) {
        return arr;
    }
    
    // Divide the array into two halves
    const mid = Math.floor(arr.length / 2);
    const leftHalf = arr.slice(0, mid);
    const rightHalf = arr.slice(mid);
    
    // Recursively sort the two halves
    const sortedLeftHalf = mergeSort(leftHalf);
    const sortedRightHalf = mergeSort(rightHalf);
    
    // Merge the sorted halves
    return merge(sortedLeftHalf, sortedRightHalf);
}

function merge(left, right) {
    let result = [];
    let leftIndex = 0;
    let rightIndex = 0;

    // Compare elements from both arrays and add the smaller one to the result array
    while (leftIndex < left.length && rightIndex < right.length) {
        if (left[leftIndex] < right[rightIndex]) {
            result.push(left[leftIndex]);
            leftIndex++;
        } else {
            result.push(right[rightIndex]);
            rightIndex++;
        }
    }

    // Add remaining elements from left array
    while (leftIndex < left.length) {
        result.push(left[leftIndex]);
        leftIndex++;
    }

    // Add remaining elements from right array
    while (rightIndex < right.length) {
        result.push(right[rightIndex]);
        rightIndex++;
    }

    return result;
}


```

### Algorithm Detailed Explanation
1. The `mergeSort` function takes an array `arr` as input and returns the sorted array.
2. If the length of the input array is less than or equal to 1, the function returns the array as it is already sorted.
3. Otherwise, the function calculates the middle index of the array and divides it into two halves: `leftHalf` and `rightHalf`.
4. The function recursively calls `mergeSort` on the two halves to sort them.
5. The sorted halves are then merged using the `merge` function, which compares elements from both halves and adds them to the result array in sorted order.
6. The merged array is returned as the final sorted array.

## Complexity Analysis
The time complexity of the Merge Sort algorithm is O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the input array. 
This is because the array is divided into halves recursively, and the merge operation takes O(n) time.
