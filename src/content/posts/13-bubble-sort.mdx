## Question
Bubble Sort is a sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, 
and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed,
which indicates that the list is sorted.

<CodeEditor 
    initialCode={"const bubbleSort = (myArray) => {\n...\n}"}
    checkTests={[
        {
        call: "bubbleSort([9,4,2,1,5])",
        expectedResult: [1,2,4,5,9]
        },
        {
        call: "bubbleSort([])",
        expectedResult: []
        },
        {
        call: "bubbleSort([9,-1,4,-2,-3,8])",
        expectedResult: [-3,-2,-1,4,8,9],
        hidden: true
        },
        {
        call: "bubbleSort([1,2,3,4,5,6])",
        expectedResult: [1,2,3,4,5,6],
        hidden: true
        },
        ]}

## Solution

```js
const bubbleSort = (arr) => {
    const n = arr.length;
    for (let i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
            if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                // Swap arr[j] and arr[j+1]
                [arr[j], arr[j + 1]] = [arr[j + 1], arr[j]];
            }
        }
    }
    return arr;

}
```

### Algorithm Detailed Explanation
1. The outer loop runs from 0 to n-1, where n is the number of elements in the array.
2. The inner loop runs from 0 to n-i-1, where i is the current iteration of the outer loop.
3. In each iteration of the inner loop, we compare adjacent elements and swap them if they are in the wrong order.
4. After each iteration of the outer loop, the largest element in the unsorted part of the array bubbles up to its correct position.
5. The algorithm repeats this process until no swaps are needed, indicating that the array is sorted.

## Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity: O(n^2) in the worst case, where n is the number of elements in the array.
- Space complexity: O(1) as the algorithm sorts the array in place without using any extra space.
