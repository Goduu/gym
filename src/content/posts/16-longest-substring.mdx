## Question
Given a string, find the largest chain of characters without repetition, i.e., find the longest substring without any repeating characters.

<CodeEditor 
    initialCode={`
const longestSubstring = (str) => {\n...\n}`}
    checkTests={[
        {
        call: `
        longestSubstring("abcdefghipqrstuvwxyz")`,
        expectedResult: "abcdefghipqrstuvwxyz"
        },
        {
        call: `
        longestSubstring("abcabcabcabcabcabcd")`,
        expectedResult: "abcd"
        },
        {
        call: `
        longestSubstring("")`,
        expectedResult: "",
        hidden: true
        },
        {
        call: `
        longestSubstring("asdfgha")`,
        expectedResult: "asdfgh",
        hidden: true
        },
        {
        call: `
        longestSubstring("aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa")`,
        expectedResult: "a",
        hidden: true
        },
        ]}

## Solution

### Basic idea
The basic idea is to use a sliding window approach to find the longest substring without repeating characters. 
We will use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to define the window. We will keep track of the characters we have seen so far using a set. 
If we encounter a character that is already in the set, we will remove the character at the `left` pointer from the set and increment the `left` pointer. +
We will update the longest substring if the current substring is longer than the previous longest substring.

```js
const longestSubstring = (str) => {
    const seen = new Set();
    let left = 0;
    let right = 0;
    let maxSubstring = '';
    
    while (right < str.length) {
        if (!seen.has(str[right])) {
            seen.add(str[right]);
            if (right - left + 1 > maxSubstring.length) {
                maxSubstring = str.slice(left, right + 1);
            }
            right++;
        } else {
            seen.delete(str[left]);
            left++;
        }
    }
    
    return maxSubstring;
}


```

### Algorithm Detailed Explanation
1. Create a set to store the characters we have seen so far.
2. Create two pointers, `left` and `right`, and initialize them to 0.
3. Create a variable `maxSubstring` to store the longest substring without repeating characters.
4. Iterate through the string using the `right` pointer.
5. If the character at the `right` pointer is not in the set, add it to the set and increment the `right` pointer.
6. If the character at the `right` pointer is in the set, remove the character at the `left` pointer from the set and increment the `left` pointer.
7. Update the `maxSubstring` if the current substring is longer than the previous longest substring.
8. Return the `maxSubstring` after the loop ends.

## Complexity Analysis
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.


## Alternative
### Burte Force

```js
const longestSubstring = (str) =>  {
    let longestLength = 0;
    let longestSubstring = '';
    
    for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j <= str.length; j++) {
            const substring = str.slice(i, j);
            const set = new Set(substring);
            if (set.size === substring.length && substring.length > longestLength) {
                longestLength = substring.length;
                longestSubstring = substring;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return longestSubstring;
}
```
