## Question
Given two lists of characters, find the common characters between them.
### Example
for the lists:  and ["b", "c", "c", "d"], the common characters are ["b", "c", "c"].

```mathematica
Lists: ["a", "b", "c", "c"] and ["b", "c", "c", "d"]
Result: ["b", "c", "c"]
```

<CodeEditor 
    initialCode={`
const commonChars = (array1, array2) => {\n...\n}`}
    checkTests={[
        {
        call: `
        commonChars(["a","b","c","d"], ["a","b","c"])`,
        expectedResult: ["a", "b", "c"]
        },
        {
        call: `
        commonChars(["a", "b", "c", "c"], ["a", "c", "c", "d"])`,
        expectedResult: ["a", "c", "c"]
        },
        {
        call: `
        commonChars([], ["a", "b", "c", "c"])`,
        expectedResult: [],
        hidden: true
        },
        {
        call: `
        commonChars(["a", "a", "a"], ["a"])`,
        expectedResult: ["a"],
        hidden: true
        }
        
        ]}

## Solution

### Basic idea
- We can use a hash map to store the frequency of characters in the first list.
- Then, we can iterate through the second list and check if the character is present in the hash map.
- If the character is present, we can decrement the frequency in the hash map and add the character to the result array.


```js
const commonChars = (array1, array2) => {
    const freqMap = new Map();
    const result = [];

    for (const char of array1) {
        freqMap.set(char, (freqMap.get(char) || 0) + 1);
    }

    for (const char of array2) {
        if (freqMap.has(char) && freqMap.get(char) > 0) {
            result.push(char);
            freqMap.set(char, freqMap.get(char) - 1);
        }
    }

    return result;
};
```

### Algorithm Detailed Explanation
1. Create a hash map to store the frequency of characters in the first list.
2. Iterate through the first list and populate the hash map with the frequency of each character.
3. Iterate through the second list and check if the character is present in the hash map and has a frequency greater than 0.
4. If the character is present and has a frequency greater than 0, add the character to the result array and decrement the frequency in the hash map.
5. Return the result array containing the common characters between the two lists.

## Complexity Analysis
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the total number of characters in both lists.
