## Question
Given an integer, convert it to a hexadecimal representation.

### Example
```mathematica
Input: 26
Output: "1a"
```

<CodeEditor 
    initialCode={`
const intToHex = (myInt) => {\n...\n}`}
    checkTests={[
        {
        call: `
        intToHex(4)`,
        expectedResult: "4"
        },
        {
        call: `
        intToHex(26)`,
        expectedResult: "1a"
        },
        {
        call: `
        intToHex(152)`,
        expectedResult: "98",
        hidden: true
        },
        {
        call: `
        intToHex(0)`,
        expectedResult: "0",
        hidden: true
        }

## Solution

### Loping through the number

#### Basic idea
- We can convert a number to hexadecimal by repeatedly dividing the number by 16 and keeping track of the remainders.
- For negative numbers, we can use two's complement representation to convert them to positive numbers before converting them to hexadecimal.

```js
const intToHex = (myInt) => {
    if (myInt === 0) return "0";
    if (myInt < 0) {
        myInt = 0xFFFFFFFF + myInt + 1;
    }
    let hex = "";
    while (myInt > 0) {
        const remainder = myInt % 16;
        hex = (remainder < 10 ? remainder : String.fromCharCode(remainder + 87)) + hex;
        myInt = Math.floor(myInt / 16);
    }
    return hex;
}
```

#### Algorithm Detailed Explanation
1. If the input number is 0, return "0".
2. If the input number is negative, convert it to a positive number using two's complement representation.
3. Initialize an empty string `hex` to store the hexadecimal representation of the number.
4. While the input number is greater than 0, do the following:
    - Calculate the remainder when the number is divided by 16.
    - If the remainder is less than 10, append it to the `hex` string.
    - If the remainder is greater than or equal to 10, convert it to the corresponding hexadecimal character and append it to the `hex` string.
    - Update the input number by dividing it by 16 (integer division).
5. Return the `hex` string as the hexadecimal representation of the input number.


#### Complexity Analysis
- The time complexity of this solution is O(log(n)), where n is the input number.
- The space complexity is O(log(n)) as well, due to the space used to store the hexadecimal representation.

### Built-in Method

```js
const intToHex = (myInt) => {
    return myInt.toString(16);
}
```
#### Basic idea
- JavaScript provides a built-in method `toString` that can be used to convert a number to a string in a specified base.
- We can use this method with a base of 16 to convert a number to its hexadecimal representation.

#### Complexity Analysis
- The time complexity of this solution is O(1) since it uses a built-in method.
- The space complexity is O(1) as well.
