## Question
Write a program that receives an array of positive numbers. 
And return an array of strings with the same size of the original array.
For multiples of three return "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five returns "Buzz". 
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz". If not multiple of three nor five return the number.

        {
        id: 1,
        call: "fizzBuzz([1,3,3,5,10,15,7])",
        expectedResult: ["1", "Fizz", "Fizz", "Buzz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz", "7"]
        },
        ]}

## Solution

```js
const fizzBuzz = (myArray) => {
    const result = []
    for(const i of myArray){
        if(i%3 === 0 && i%5 === 0){
            result.push("FizzBuzz")
        } else if(i%3 === 0 ){
            result.push("Fizz")
        } else if(i%5 === 0){
            result.push("Buzz")
        } else {
            result.push(i.toString())
        }
    }
    return result
}
```

### Explanation
The operation is simple.
We loop through the numbers from 1 to 100 and check if the number is divisible by 3, 5 or both. 
If it is divisible by 3, we print "Fizz", if it is divisible by 5, we print "Buzz" and if it is divisible by both 3 and 5, we print "FizzBuzz". 
If none of the conditions are met, we print the number itself.

## Complexity Analysis
The time complexity for this algorithm is O(n) where n is the number of elements in the array.


## Alternatives
```js
const fizzBuzz = () => {
    Array.from({length: 10}, (_, i) => {
        i++
        let output = ""
        if(i % 3 === 0) output += "Fizz"
        if(i % 5 === 0) output += "Buzz"
        console.log(output || i)
    })
}
```
